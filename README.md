Created this repo using GitHub copilot to suggest code and write most of the functions.
Interestingly I also asked it to complete the reflection part of this assignment which you can see below.
Really interesting how it manages to effectively mirror self-reflection even down to the self-criticism on line 15 below.

Learned some interesting details about Python, could see the similarities to JavaScript particuarly around defining functions but the syntax is obviously different. Initially I'd say the syntax is easier but I didn't realise the impact of indentation with Python so when I manually typed some code, it very quickly broke everything as I didn't indent it.

# CoPilotTest

This repository contains solutions to various katas, generated with the help of GitHub Copilot.

## Learning Experience

Learning a new programming language can be challenging, but it's also an exciting opportunity to expand my skill set. With the help of GitHub Copilot, I was able to quickly grasp the syntax and idioms of the new language. The AI's ability to generate code snippets and function implementations was particularly helpful.

## Observations

One of the easiest aspects was getting instant code suggestions as I typed, which made the coding process smoother. However, it was sometimes difficult to understand the logic behind the generated code, especially for complex problems. I had to spend some time debugging and refining the code to ensure it worked as expected.

## Conclusion

Overall, using GitHub Copilot was a unique and enlightening experience. It's a powerful tool that can significantly speed up the coding process, especially for developers who are learning a new language or working on unfamiliar problems.
